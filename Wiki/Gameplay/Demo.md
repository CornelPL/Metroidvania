# What to show in demo?

- USPs:
	- using gravity on everything which comes with destroyable environment
		Every lying item can be thrown. Parts of the enemies, every rock, foliage (could just fly and do no damage).
		Staying objects can be destroyed with thrown item. Thrown item does stop only on enemies or undestroyable objects. It destroys everything it flies by.
	- great fight feeling
		Pulling effects, shooting effects, everything can be thrown.
		Counterattacking enemies
			When enemy charges or does some special action hint with button shows up to counterattack. If player hits it in time he grabs enemy with gravity and can throw him away.
			Special animations:
				- counterattacking charger - when he charges player can press RMB to rotate him and pull his head from the body - the body "runs" further and player is holding his head
	- exploration and environment storytelling
		Exploration done with player's abilities. Slam and planks in soft wall.
